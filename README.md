# Fitting a Logistic Regression Model From Scratch

This is my senior capstone project from Quinnipiac. In this project, I evaluate the performance of several machine learning models when used to predict credit card fraud. I used SMOTE to address the dataset imbalance, and investigated how this affects model performance. 

# File Descriptions
**Report.md**- Comprehensive project report, which includes the mathematical background to the optimization procedure used throughout the project.

**functions.py**- Python file which contains functions used for model fitting.

**test_case**- Python test case file. This file uses functions from functions.py to manually fit a logistic regression model, from data import to parameter convergence. 

# Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle. Here is a link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
